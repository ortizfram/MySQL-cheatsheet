Here the scripts that where used for examples üëá (most of them from first folder)

https://bit.ly/3rvtqdO

###### üíÅcommented code is like this ‚§µÔ∏è
` --` SELECT * FROM customers

## 1 Use dataBase
database
```
USE database_name;
```
-------------------------------------------
# # üü¢ SELECT

all or
column
```
SELECT *
SELECT customer_id, fisrt_name
```
- FUNTIONS



ü§ô EXAMPLE

üßÆ calculate discount w user_points

 `AS var_name`
```
SELECT first_name, points, (points * 10) + 100 AS 'discount factor'
FROM customers
```
aritmatic expression (+,-,/,*,% (reminder of the division))

---------------------------------------
# # üü¢  FROM, WHERE, AND, OR, NOT

- `FROM`

table  (clause words)
```
FROM customers 
```

- `WHERE`
‚ÑπÔ∏è (date values are always represented between  ' ' )
```
WHERE customer_id = 1
WHERE points > 300
WHERE state = 'VA'
WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01'
```

ü§ô EXAMPLE

```
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2019-01-01' 
```


- MULTIPLE CONDITIONS `AND`, `OR`


ü§ô EXAMPLE

üßÆ birth date gratter than 2019, AND +1000 points

üßÆ OR = 1 of 2 conditions AND state = 'virginia'
```
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birth_date >= '1990-01-01' AND points > 1000

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birth_date >= '2019-01-01' 
(OR points > 1000 AND state = 'VA')
```
- `NOT`
```
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE NOT (birth_date >= '1990-01-01' AND points > 1000)
```
ü§ô EXAMPLE

üßÆ get items FOR ORDER #6, WHERE total price greater than 30

```
SELECT * 
from order_items
WHERE order_id = 6 AND unit_price * quantity > 30
```

-------------------------------------
# # üü¢ OPERATORS // NOT, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, REGEXP, IS NULL

- `IN`, `NOT IN` operator

‚ÑπÔ∏è same as OR but you can write all values together like this :

ü§ô EXAMPLE
```
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE  state IN ('VA', 'FL', 'GA')
```


- `BETWEEN`

‚ÑπÔ∏è same as <=, >=

ü§ô EXAMPLE

```
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000


SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1-1-1990' AND '2000-1-1'
```

- `LIKE` 

ü§ô EXAMPLE

‚ÑπÔ∏è you put the **%** to declare what you re looking for 

ü•ê LIKE 'b%' = STARTs w B

ü•ê LIKE '%b%' = has a B ANYWhERE

ü•ê LIKE '%b' = ENDs w B


ü•ê LIKE '_y' = SECOND CHAR equals Y

üßÆ when string starts like **b%**:... 

```
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name LIKE 'b%'

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name LIKE '%b%'

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name LIKE '%b'


```
- `REGEXP`

‚ÑπÔ∏è same as LIKE 

ü•ê REGEXP '^field' = phrase STARTs w field...

ü§ôEXAMPLE üßÆ starts w : my , or contains: SE
```
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP '^my|se'
```

ü•ê REGEXP 'field$' = phrase ENDs w ...field

ü§ôEXAMPLE üßÆ last name ends w :   ey OR on 
```
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP 'ey$|on$'
```

ü•ê REGEXP 'field|Mac' = phrases HAS fiel OR mac ‚≠ê you can combine them 


ü•ê REGEXP '[ae]d' = HAS an A/E BEFORE D

ü•ê REGEXP 'd[ae]' = HAS an D after a/e

ü§ôEXAMPLE üßÆ contains :b  , followed by : r or u
```
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP 'b[ru]'
```
ü•ê REGEXP '[a-d]r' = HAS A--to--D AFTER R

- `IS NULL`  ‚ÑπÔ∏è where column is empty

ü§ôEXAMPLE üßÆ orders that were not shipped
```
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE shipped_date IS NULL
```
--------------------------------------
# # üü¢ ORDER BY clause ‚ÑπÔ∏è for sorting data for columns

ü•ê ORDER BY first_name DESC = descending
```
ORDER BY first_name
```
ü§ôEXAMPLE üßÆ sort by state descendent,  and if repeated, sort by name
```
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY state DESC, first_name
```
ü§ôEXAMPLE üßÆ calculate total_price Where order id = 2 ‚≠ê
```
SELECT *, quantity * unit_price AS total_price
FROM order_items
WHERE order_id = 2
ORDER BY total_price DESC
```

-------------------------------------------
# # üü¢ LIMIT clause 

```
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 3
```
ü•ê LIMIT 6, 3 = offset

ü§ôEXAMPLE üßÆ dont show first 6, and then show 3 

should be showing 7-9
```
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 6, 3
```

ü§ôEXAMPLEüßÆ get top 3 loyal customers (more points)
```
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY points DESC
LIMIT 3

```
-------------------------------------------
# # üü¢ INNER JOINS 
‚ÑπÔ∏è üëÅÔ∏è if you have same column  in multiple tables, you have to prefix them with the table_name.column

‚ÑπÔ∏è üëÅÔ∏è ALIAS : is like this > FROM orders o, so nxt time you write it you use **o** for orders

ü§ôEXAMPLEüßÆwhat im joining is the last 3 columns to order's table that its limited just to order_id
```
SELECT order_id, first_name, last_name,  c.customer_id
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
	ON o.customer_id =  c.customer_id
```
‚ùìON o.customer_id =  c.customer_id üëá

this  means we're saying that the foreing key in those 2 tables, will be the same in this NEW TABLE

ü§ôEXAMPLEüßÆ join orders w products , for each order return pr id and name, followed by quantity and unit price from order item table
```
SELECT order_id, p.product_id, quantity, oi.unit_price
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON 
	oi.product_id = p.product_id
```
-------------------------------------------
# # üü¢ JOINING ACROSS DATABASES 
ü§ôEXAMPLEüßÆ combining columns from databases


```
SELECT *
FROM order_items oi
JOIN sql_inventory.products p
	ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
```
-------------------------------------------
# # üü¢ SELF JOINS
ü§ôEXAMPLEüßÆ write the manager's name for every employer 

```
USE  sql_hr;

    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    m.first_name AS manager 
FROM employees e

	ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id 
```
-------------------------------------------
# # üü¢ MULTIPLE JOINS
üßÆhere we re joining 3 tables 

üëá JOIN customers c

‚ùìin o.customer_id i want -> c.customer_id

‚ÑπÔ∏è üëÅÔ∏è here we saying that foreign keys of both tables are the same
